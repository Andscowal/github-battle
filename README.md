This app is live and is hosted by firebase @ https://github-battle-78b78-3d20f.firebaseapp.com/

This was a tutorial based project with the intentions of learning React.js.

While building the app, I learned a firm understand of React and it's ecosystem. 
One of my favorite parts about building the app came at the beginning where I learned about Webpack and Babel.
As I was first learning React, I loved the bootstrapping method "create-react-app" that was wonderfully given to us,
but I found that I had no idea about some of the technologies it made use of on the back end, like Webpack and Babel.
I knew what they were and why they were used, but not how. This app really furthered my understanding of that.

Furthermore, I learned a lot about React best practices and gained an in depth knowledge of the inner workings of React, 
such as the different benefits between <strong>stateless/pure functions and and stateful functions</strong>, the power of <strong>states</strong>,
 and why building <strong>highly reusable components</strong> is not only valuable, but required. 
 
 Thank you for stopping by and happy coding!
